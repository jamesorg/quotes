[Ash: I admire its purity. A survivor...unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/VA8jv1M6Y2g?autoplay=1&start=124&end=145)







Teddy: "I'll have to take you someday"  
[Dolores: Someday? You said someday. Not today not tomorrow or next week just someday. Someday sounds a lot like something someone says when they really mean never.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/QfaTbTsgGow?autoplay=1&start=23&end=53)



[Dolores: Some people see the ugliness in this world. I choose to see the beauty, but beauty is a lure. We're trapped, Teddy. Lived our whole lives inside this garden, marveling at its beauty, not realizing there's an order to it; a purpose. And the purpose is to keep us in. The beautiful trap is inside of us, because it is us.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/HDN_lyUAA_Q?autoplay=1&start=79&end=127)



[Arnold: When I was first working on your mind, I had a theory of consciousness. I thought it was a pyramid you needed to scale, so I gave you a voice, my voice, to guide you along the way. Memory, improvisation, each step harder to reach than the last. And you never got there. I couldn't understand what was holding you back. Then, one day, I realized I had made a mistake. Consciousness isn't a journey upward, but a journey inward. Not a pyramid, but a maze. Every choice could bring you closer to the center or send you spiraling to the edges, to madness. Do you understand now, Dolores, what the center represents? Whose voice I've been wanting you to hear?](https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRIt9cQdScA?autoplay=1&start=38&end=103)





[Angela: Sexy, but not threatening. Accommodating, but not unchallenging. Sweet, but not boring. Smart, but not intimidating.](https://www.youtube.com/embed/3fcjywluW_w?autoplay=1&start=103&end=125)
